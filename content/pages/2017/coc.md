Title: Code of Conduct
URL: 2017/coc.html
save_as: 2017/coc.html


Python is a diverse community who maintains a reputation as a friendly,
welcoming, inspiring and dynamic group. We’d like to keep it that way,
which is why we ask all attendees, organizers and sponsors to follow this
code of conduct (CoC).

If you have questions regarding this CoC, please contact the EuroSciPy CoC WG.
Your questions will only be seen by the members of the CoC workgroup and
treated confidentially.

### Be nice to each other

We trust that attendees will treat each other in a way that reflects the widely
held view that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our community to be
celebrated and fostered.

Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:

* be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
* be free from any form of discrimination, victimization, harassment or
  bullying;
* enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behavior, inappropriate language and
  unsuitable imagery.

### Solving problems

If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact
**info** at the domain euroscipy.org.
Any complaint will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and
dealt with appropriately.

The EuroSciPy organizers reserve the right to carry out any of the following
actions relating to a complaint:

* The person concerned may be told to stop/modify his/her behavior
  appropriately and a warning will be issued.
* The person concerned may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if
  the behavior continues.
* The person concerned may be asked to leave the venue immediately and/or may
  be prohibited from continuing to attend EuroSciPy (without refund).
* The incident may be reported to the local authorities.

### Be professional and don’t spam

We consider Python a great setting to showcase the work of the community and
would like to encourage networking and business related discussions, as well as
keep the conference presentations meaningful and interesting for everyone.

We therefore:

* only allow company marketing or recruiting related activities at the
  conference in accordance with our sponsor agreements;
* request presentations - outside the official recruiting sessions - to focus
  on Python related topics, not on recruitment.

The EuroSciPy Organizers will be happy to answer any questions related to
marketing or recruiting activities.
