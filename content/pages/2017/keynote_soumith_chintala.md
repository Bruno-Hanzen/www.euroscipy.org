### PyTorch: a framework for fast, dynamic deep learning and scientific computing

#### Short summary

In this session, you shall be introduced to a new framework for scientific computing, mainly
aimed at deep learning workloads. The framework consists of an ndarray library that natively
supports GPU execution, an automatic differentiation engine that is flexible and fast, and
an optimization package for gradient based optimization methods. We shall discuss practical
workflows, our features on top of python multiprocessing for efficient parallel data loaders
and finally we shall briefly look at our upcoming just-in-time Tensor compiler to fuse
computations and execute them more efficiently.
