# AutoWIG: Wrapping very large C++ libraries in Python automatically

Most of Python and R scientific packages incorporate compiled scientific libraries to speed up the execution of the code needed for high-performance computing and to reuse legacy libraries.

Several semi-automatic solutions exist to wrap these compiled libraries: SWIG, Cython, Boost.Python.
However, the process of wrapping a large C++ library is cumbersome and time consuming, mainly due some high-level constructs that have no equivalent in Python (template, complex iterators, ...).

In this talk, we introduce AutoWIG, a Python package that enables full C++ introspection using LLVM/Clang technologies.
Default strategies have been designed to transform any C++ construct into Python, using Boost.Python for instance.
Based on the introspection, a set of classes, methods, namespaces are retrieve and Boost.Python code is generated using the Mako template engine.

Our approach is automatic, extensible, and applies to complex C++ libraries, composed of thousands of classes or incorporating modern meta-programming constructs.
For instance, we wrap with AutoWIG the full Clang library to obtain full introspection on C++ code such as template classes.
[Jupyter notebooks](http://autowig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) and [Docker images](http://autowig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/docker.html) render AutoWIG easy to pick up and play with.
The source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/StatisKit/AutoWIG) and binaries can be [installed](http://autowig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/anaconda.html) with Conda.
Designed as a library, this package can easily be integrated with compiler toolchains, such as SCons, to ease the development process of teams.
A more detailed description of this package can be read on this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11000).

During the talk, we will describe AutoWIG main features and cover how you can generate Python bindings for your C++ libraries illustrating by various Jupyter notebooks.
In particular, we will explain how we have bootstrapped the wrapping of LLVM/Clang in Python, using libclang, to provide unavailable features such as introspection on C++ templates from Python.
An example of the wrapping of C++  [linear algebra](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) and  [statistical](http://github.com/StatisKit) libraries to benefit of state-of-the-art graphical model learning algorithms will be discussed in depth.
