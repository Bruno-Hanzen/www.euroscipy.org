This hands-on workshop will introduce the main concepts of Machine Learning such as building features from raw data, fitting an estimator, evaluating predictive accuracy with cross-validation and mitigating overfitting issues. Those concepts will be illustrated by running through a typical predictive modeling pipeline involving pandas, numpy, [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) and matplotlib in a Jupyter notebook.

Attendees should install the following packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- scikit-learn 0.18.1 or later

First time users are advised to use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to get everything installed prior to attending the workshop.

Please use Python 3! Python 2 is legacy.

Basic knowledge of the Scipy ecosystem (numpy, matplotlib, jupyter...) is recommended to attend  this workshop.
