# Description

1. _Multi-layer Fully Connected Networks_
In this notebook we will learn the basic building blocks of Keras APIs to create deep neural networks. We will learn how to use the `Sequential` object as well as _Functional_ and `keras.backend` APIs. First examples of MLP and Fully Connected Networks will be presented.

2. _Bootleneck Features and Embeddings_ 
After having played a bit with Keras APIs for building networks, we start learn how to inspect network's internals. In details, we will learn (1) how to iterate over layers; (2) how to initialise and get weights; (3) how to extract bottleneck features and create embeddings.

3. _Convolutional Networks_
This notebook will teach how to build CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). Convolutional, Pooling, DropOut layers will be presented, along with clear description on how to properly apply convolutions on images, depending on `image_dim_ordering` setting.

4. _Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning_
The Keras implementation of some famous Deep Convolutional Networks  will be presented (i.e. `keras.applications.vgg16`, `keras.applications.vgg19`, and `keras.applications.inceptionv3`). We will learn how to leverage on these models for transfer learning and fine tuning using Keras `Layer` APIs.

5. _Residual Networks_
In this notebook, Residual Networks will be presented. In particular, the Keras implementation of the residual network topology will be explained. Then, ResNet (`keras.applications.resnet50`)  Keras implementation will be detailed.   

6. _Recurrent Neural Networks_
Recurrent Neural Networks (i.e. LSTM and GRU) are the main topic of this notebook. The Keras implementation of these two types of network will be presented along with working examples combining Word Embeddings and Convolutional Layers (i.e. `keras.layers.convolutional_recurrent`)

7. _[Variational] AutoEncoders and Adversarials_
This notebook will be devoted to show how to implement AutoEncoders in Keras. In particular, the implementation of Stacked AutoEncoders, Variational AutoEncoders and Generative Adversarial Networks will be presented.

8. _Multi-Modal Networks_
Multi-Input and Multi-task Networks are the fundamental steps for advanced deep networks. This notebook will provide implementation recipes and examples. 
 
9. _Custom Layers and Optimisers_
This notebook will provide details and examples of Keras internals. In particular, we will learn how to implement a Custom Layer in Keras, and custom Activation functions, and custom optimisers. 
 
10. _Interactive Networks and Callbacks_ 
In this last notebook, `keras.callbacks` will be explained. Callbacks to track and monitor network performances during the training process will be built and integrated inside a web app. Finally, an example of `keras-js` will be described, detailing functions in Keras to export models and weights (in `json` and `hdf5` formats).

# Requirements
This tutorial requires the following packages:

- Python version 3.5.x
		- Python 3.4 is fine as well
		- likely Python 2.7 would also be fine, but *who knows*? :P
    
- `numpy` version 1.10 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `scipy` version 0.16 or later: http://www.scipy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.4 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `pandas` version 0.16 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org
- `scikit-learn` version 0.15 or later: http://scikit-learn.org
- `keras` version 1.0 or later: http://keras.io
- `tensorflow` version 0.9 or later: https://www.tensorflow.org
- `ipython`/`jupyter` version 4.0 or later, with notebook support

(Optional but recommended):

- `pyyaml`
- `hdf5` and `h5py` (required if you use model saving/loading functions in keras)

The easiest way to get (most) these is to use an all-in-one installer such as [Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum. These are available for multiple architectures.
