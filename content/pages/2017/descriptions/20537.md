# Deep Learning for Fraud Detection 

In this talk I will discuss Machine Learning pipeline set up to prevent frauds in user authentications. The analysis relies on keystroke dynamics to learn from user's behavioural patterns and detect anomalous access. Results obtained on data of real users accessing their bank accounts will be presented, along with code examples in scikit-learn and Keras.
