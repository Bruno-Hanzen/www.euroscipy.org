# INTRODUCTION TO SYMPY - TUTORIAL

In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy, a computer aided algebra system (CAS) written in Python. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this tutorial, we will show how to solve practical problems with SymPy. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.

Attendees will take home an introductory level understanding of SymPy. This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPyâ€™s internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries. The tutorial will cover the topics such as Gotchas, Basic Operations, Calculus, Matrices, etc.

The tutorial will be based mostly on the tutorial presented at SciPy, Austin, 2016. The old notebooks can be accessed here https://github.com/sympy/scipy-2016-tutorial
