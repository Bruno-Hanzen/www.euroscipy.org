# Intro to Cython

You've probably heard of Cython as a tool for fast data processing. Well, it's more than that. Over the years, the Cython compiler has become a major pillar in the Python ecosystem, helping Python users all over the world to crunch their data, write fast and portable native code, and integrate native libraries into their Python workflow. Several excellent projects from the scientific Python world chose Cython to allow "normal people" to write and maintain efficient code for complex scientific algorithms, whenever Python itself comes to its limits.

In this tutorial, I will present the Cython compiler and quickly show how to speed up code with it, how to talk to native code, and a couple of more things that you might want to try out with it.
