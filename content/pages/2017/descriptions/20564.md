# BluVision - An image analysis framework for quantification of plant pathogen interaction phenotypes

Deep investigation of the intimate details of the plant-pathogen interactions is essential to truly understand the defense mechanism of the plants and the evading strategies of the pathogens. By using this knowledge in plant breeding we may significantly diminish the enormous disease-related losses in agriculture by simultaneous reduction of application of potentially hazardous pesticides. 
We have developed the BluVision image analysis Framework for studying plant-pathogen interactions on micro- and macroscopic level. The system is build to cover the complete life cycle of the important barley and wheat pathogen powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) by collecting and analyzing image data from three key developmental stages but can be applied also to other plant-pathogen interactions.
