## What is SymPy?

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.

## What will you learn in it?
Want to solve your basic to advanced class symbolic mathematical problems?
If *yes*, then you have come to the right place.

1. How to install and configure this Python module?
2. Basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy.
3. We will also discuss the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the remaining part of this tutorial we will show how to solve mathematical problems with SymPy.

## Prerequisite

The tutorial will only assume a basic knowledge of Python and mathematics. **No prior knowledge of SymPy or other Python libraries is required**, although it is suggested that attendees be familiar with the jupyter notebook. A mathematical knowledge of calculus is recommended.
