# When less is more: dimensionality reduction in neuroscience
With the advent of modern techniques, neuroscientists are able to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously. Understanding the neural computations underlying behavior in these large datasets can become increasingly difficult, and classical analysis tools such as trial-averaged single-neuron responses may not meet the challenge. 

In this context, dimensionality reduction can be very powerful, as it offers a low dimensional representation of the full population activity, which can aid interpretation, visualization, and the formulation of new hypotheses. While PCA remains by far the most common and widely applied method, in recent years several other techniques have been proposed, each addressing some of the limitations of PCA.

In this talk, I will introduce a few of the latest algorithms that have been developed to perform dimensionality reduction in the context of neural data. Then, I will show how I applied these methods to a massively parallel recording of 156 neurons in the macaque motor cortex during an instructed reach-to-grasp task. 

Python is essential in this process as it offers flexible data structures which allow to effortlessly represent highly structured neuroscientific data and lightning-fast prototyping for exploratory analysis. 

Importantly, through the comparative application of the different methods to the same dataset, it will become clear how each method offers a different perspective and sheds a unique light on the data.
