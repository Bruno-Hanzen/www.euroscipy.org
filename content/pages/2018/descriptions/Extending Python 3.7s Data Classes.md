# Extending Python 3.7s Data Classes
One of the exiting new features in Python 3.7 is the Data Class. Modeled after the popular `attrs` project, data classes allow for flexible creation of well behaving Python classes with minimal boilerplate code.

This presentation will introduce data classes, and show how you can start using them in your own projects. Then we will show how the data classes can be combined with the powerful data analysis tools we already use everyday, like `numpy`, `pandas` and `jupyter`.
