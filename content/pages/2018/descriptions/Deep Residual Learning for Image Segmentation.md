# Deep Residual Learning for Image Segmentation
Our talk will mostly consist of the content from our blog post:
http://warmspringwinds.github.io/tensorflow/tf-slim/2017/01/23/fully-convolutional-networks-(fcns)-for-image-segmentation/

But updated with the recent state-of-the-art methods.

The library that we are presenting can be found here (+ examples of the results ):
