# RepSeP - Reproducible Self-Publishing for Python-Based Research.
The tutorial introduction will highlight the continuing importance of traditional publication formats in science communication, and how they can be integrated as closely as possible with a Scientific Python data analysis development cycle.
The conventions which RepSeP employs to facilitate such integration are automatic “live” output element (e.g. figures, tables, text) generation and integration in the resulting document, and text/code and style/content separation in the source files.
Distinctions between this convention and the arbitrary splicing of natural and programming language syntax (as e.g. in Jupyter) will be discussed.

The embodiment of these conventions in the directory structure will be explained, showing how Python code (producing plots, tables, or inline statistic reports) can best be stored in dedicated scripts, and how the same scripts can be used with different style conventions across documents.
The choice of LaTeX for the document typesetting will be introduced, and the automatic execution of Python functions at LaTeX document build time will be demonstrated.
Following up, the dependency tracking system of PythonTeX (the underlying LaTeX-Python integration package) will briefly be summarized.

Participants will be given the opportunity to clone the RepSeP repository, and hack it to showcase some of their own work - in effect producing (and with upload, self-publishing) a reproducible article, poster, or presentation Slide Set.
Future plans, challenges, and current limitations of the concept will be presented; and contributions in the form of code, commentary, and criticism will be encouraged.

Lastly, the distribution aspect of such self-contained reproducible publications will be put into perspective.
Numerous challenges face modern science, not least of which are bureaucracy, centralization, and intransparency.
A distributed body of reproducible and independently published research would serve to decentralize the scientific process, reduce the barrier of entry (for reading, reproducing, as well as publishing), and increase the potential depth of peer review and author collaboration.
