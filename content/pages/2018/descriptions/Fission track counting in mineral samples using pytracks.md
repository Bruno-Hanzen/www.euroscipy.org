# Fission track counting in mineral samples using pytracks
Fission track dating of minerals requires determining the fission-track density in mineral samples. Track counting is usually done using an optical microscope, or in images obtained from it. Manual procedures for measuring and counting tracks are time-consuming and involve some practical problems; researchers have wished automated counting a while ago, but the literature on this issue remains scarce. We present pytracks, an open source package aimed to automatic counting based on image processing, that increases the track counting rate and improves counting reproducibility.
