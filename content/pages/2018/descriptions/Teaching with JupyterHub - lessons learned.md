# Teaching with JupyterHub - lessons learned
JupyterHub allows creating a multi-user Hub which spawns multiple instances of the Jupyter notebook server. At the Institute Geomatics of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland JupyterHub is used for teaching Python in the master's course "GeoProcessing". The course uses large-scale (multi-terabyte) geodata and local instances of the Jupyter Notebook are no option.
This talk shares experiences in setting up JupyterHub and it is shown how notebooks and exercises are shared with the class. 
The Institute of Geomatics also uses JupyterHub for research projects, especially involving deep learning or other tasks where GPUs and a high performance compute clusters are required. It will be shown how we currently set this up and how we plan to do it in near future.
