the goal of the project is to engage Parkinsonâ€™s patients in physical activity to delay progression of disease. Though Parkinson's disease is not curable but it can be delayed with the help of physical exercises. The project features a simple exercise game where user have to lift his/her hands in the air and the movements are tracked with the help of OpenCV. Demo: https://goo.gl/ifjafj
