# Pythonizing workflows with with modern and legacy chemistry softwares.
Legacy software is characterized by being difficult to change and difficult to test. Scientific legacy software typically has a long history with contributions from many PhD students over the years adding a lot of functionality but also many layers of complexity, leaving no one with an complete overview of the whole program.
Modern software initiatives to solve problems in the same scientific domain may have been developed to address modern hardware, to obtain  scaling on HPC resources. However these are never able to replace the legacy software completely due to its sheer size and the many man-hours that have been spent over the years. Some of the old functionality may be worthwhile to keep but not worth the investment to rewrite.
This presentation describes attempts to combine the best of the two worlds with Python as a front-end, as a glue between softwares from different decades written in different languages.
