# ModelXplore, a python based model exploration
Sometime, you have to deal with expensive model, or data that is hard to generate (experimental setups, expansive simulations...).

We have developed a library that help the scientist to explore such models : it give built-in sensitivity analysis, efficient samplers and meta-model companion. This companion is built on the available data and is chosen automatically across a class of meta-model. It gives access to approximation of the surface response and complete sensitivity analysis.
