# PyUnfold: the Iterative Unfolding Package
PyUnfold is an extensible framework for the deconvolution of discrete probability 
distributions via the iterative unfolding method described by D'Agostini (1995). 
This method falls into the general class of inverse problems, and is especially powerful 
when no analytic form of the inverse function is explicitly available, instead requiring
an estimate (e.g. via a finite amount of simulation) of the response function.
