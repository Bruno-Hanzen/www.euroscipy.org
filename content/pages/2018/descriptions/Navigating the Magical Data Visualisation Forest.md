# Navigating the Magical Data Visualisation Forest
There are many different Python libraries available for data visualization. These all have different philosophies, syntax and ways to create charts. To make charts in a Jupyter notebook in seconds, PixieDust integrates with any library and visualizes data in a Pandas or Spark DataFrame. matplotlib, Bokeh, seaborn and Brunel are the renderers added so far, but there are many more! In this session you will learn how to find your way in the magical forest of visualization libraries through examples creating charts, plots and maps of forest data. 

When you have created a chart it is time to leave the forest. You can share your visualizations with anyone through the PixieGateway, which lets you share charts as web applications.  

In the final part of this session you will learn how you can contribute to PixieDust by adding new visualization libraries or suggesting improvements for the existing ones. Let PixieDust be your compass to navigate the data visualisation forest!
