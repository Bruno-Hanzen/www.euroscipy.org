# Teaching programming with Jupyterhub and Nbgrader
When at EuroScipy 2011 in Paris Fernando Perez introduced the IPython notebook, now known as Jupyter notebook, its potential for teaching was immediately clear. Today the Jupyter notebook can be used together with a large variety of different programming languages. Nevertheless, in particular when teaching in a scientific context, Python is widely used, not least because of its well developed scientific ecosystem. One of the extensions available for the Jupyter notebook is nbgrader, the development of which is led by Jessica Hamrick. Nbgrader allows to release programming problems to students and later to collect and grade them.

These tools offer exciting possiblities and at the same time invite the instructor to consider interesting questions concerning the teaching concept. For example, nbgrader requires the instructor to formulate tests which allow to determine how many points should be attributed to a student's solution. At the same time, these tests can be designed to give feedback to students while they try to solve the problem assigned to them. One could even go as far as using nbgrader to introduce the spirit of test-driven development. We will discuss a few lessons learned while teaching an introductory course on programming with Jupyterhub and nbgrader.
