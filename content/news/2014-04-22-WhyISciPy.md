Summary: Looking for stories around why you participate in the SciPy community.


Why I SciPy
------------------------------------------------------------
SciPy is many things to many people.  It can be an opportunity to learn about the newest technologies or maybe old ones that you should have been using.  It is a chance to learn about new and exciting features of the packages you use the most.  SciPy is also a chance to reconnect to old friends and meet new ones. For many, it is also an opportunity to develop your skills as a scientific software developer and become a better scientist overall.

So what makes you SciPy?  We are looking for a short paragraph explaining the reasons why you SciPy. Including specific instances or reasons why the conference has had a positive impact on your science are the best!  For example,

I SciPy because it is a place where I can learn about new python packages I can leverage in my science and old packages I should have been using.  I go to learn about new and exciting features of the packages I use the most.  It is also about developing my own skills as a scientific software developer, learning about best practices and new ways to make my own work more effective.  I of course go to see old friends and make new ones.  Most of all, I SciPy to become a better scientist.

Please send submissions to
scipy-organizers@scipy.org or post to Twitter or G+ using the hashtag #whyiscipy. We'll post the best submissions of the week to future mailings.

Looking forward to hearing your story!
