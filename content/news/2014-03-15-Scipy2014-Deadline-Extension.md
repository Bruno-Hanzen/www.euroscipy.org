Submission deadline extended!
-----------------------------

Due to popular demand, the deadline for submitting talks, tutorials and posters has been extended to April 1, 2014 - no 'foolin!'  We encourage submissions related to general scientific computing with Python, one of the two special themes for this year, or the domain-specific mini-symposia held during the conference.  Take a look at a few talks (http://conference.scipy.org/past.html) from previous years, our guidelines for this year (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/presentations/) , and we look forward to reviewing submissions!
