Summary: Announcing John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest and Working towards Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experience at SciPy 2014

John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest
-------------------------------------------
In memory of John Hunter, we are pleased to announce the Second Annual SciPy John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Competition. This open competition aims to highlight the importance of quality plotting to scientific progress and showcase the capabilities of the current generation of plotting software. Participants are invited to submit scientific plots to be judged by a panel. The winning entries will be announced and displayed at the conference.

John Hunterâ€™s family is graciously sponsoring cash prizes for the contest winners in the following amounts:

* 1st prize: $1000
* 2nd prize: $750
* 3rd prize: $500

### Instructions

Entries must be submitted by March 21, 2014 via e-mail to plotting-contest@scipy.org

* Plots may be produced with any combination of Python-based tools. (It is not required that they use matplotlib, for example.)
* Source code for the plot must be provided, in the form of Python code and/or IPython notebook, along with a rendering of the plot in PDF format. If the original data can not be shared for reasons of size or licensing, "fake" data may be substituted, along with an image of the plot using real data.
* Each entry must include a 300-500 word abstract describing the plot and its scientific importance for a general scientific audience.
* Entries will be judged on their clarity, innovation and aesthetics, but most importantly for their effectiveness in illuminating real scientific work. Entrants are encouraged to submit plots that were used during the course of research, rather than merely being hypothetical.
* Scipy reserves the right to display any and all entries, whether prize-winning or not, at the conference, use in any materials or on its website, with attribution to the original author(s).

### Important dates:

* March 21, 2014: Plotting submissions due
* Winners will be announced during the Scipy conference days.

We look forward to exciting submissions that push the boundaries of plotting.

The SciPy Plotting Contest Organizing Committee:

* Michael Droettboom, Space Telescope Science Institute (chair)
* Eric Firing, University of Hawai`i at Manoa
* Jake Vanderplas, University of Washington

WSSSPE Announcement
-------------------

We are proud to announce that this year on Thursday afternoon of the conference, we will be hosting a Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practices and Experiences (WSSSPE@SciPy).  This will be an opportunity to gather together people from across the SciPy community to collect and understand best practices in sustaining communities of scientific software.  Look for more information on the SciPy conference website, but keep your Thursday afternoon free!

For information about past workshops and the collection of papers selected for the first WSSSPE workshop at Supercomputing 2013, see [http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk).


Ready, Set, Submit!
--------------------
After a slightly bumpy start abstract submission is now open!  The deadline for abstract submissions is March 14th, 2014. Submissions are welcome that address general scientific computing with Python, or one of the two special themes for this year's conference, or the domain-specific mini-symposia held during the conference. Examples talks from [previous years](http://conference.scipy.org/past.html) are available online.  We look forward to reviewing you submissions!
