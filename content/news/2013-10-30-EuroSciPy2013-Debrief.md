Summary: EuroSciPy2013 Debrief

EuroSciPy took place for the second time in Brussels in 2013. With about 200
participants, the conference is quite stable in size and in organization. The
two days of tutorials were followed by two days of scientific talks and posters
and a day of sprints (among others, the largest sprint on Scipy in a long time).
A change to the conference was the new website. We conducted no survey but the
decrease in support requests for the registration process is a good sign.

A talk/poster contest was organized, with Canopy licenses awarded to: Philippe
Gervais (best poster "Memory profiling"), Bill Little (best talk "Iris and
Cartopy: open source Python libraries for weather and climate science") and
Nicolas Rougier (jury award for the talk "Vispy, A Modern and Interactive
Scientific Visualization").

The conference ended with the announcement that EuroSciPy 2014 would take place
in Cambridge, so prepare to visit England next time! In the meantime, authors
and reviewers are preparing the EuroSciPy 2013 proceedings.
