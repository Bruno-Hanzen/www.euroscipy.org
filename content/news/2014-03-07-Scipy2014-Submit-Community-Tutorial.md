Summary: Submission announcement, Community efforts, Tutorial details, and GSOC


Submissions close in a week!
------------------------------------------------------------

Next Friday, March 14th, the submissions for talks, posters and tutorials are due.  We encourage submissions related to general scientific computing with Python, one of the two special themes for this year, or the domain-specific mini-symposia held during the conference.  Take a look at a few talks (http://conference.scipy.org/past.html) from previous years, our guidelines for this year (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/presentations/) , and we look forward to reviewing submissions!

Submit your abstracts today (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/) !


Flock Together
------------------------------------------------------------
In an effort to increase the opportunities for community building, SciPy would like to emphasize the use of birds of a feather (BoFs) sessions. These sessions usually include short presentations by a panel and a moderator with the bulk of the time spent opening up the discussion to everyone in attendance. We will organize a number of BoFs that are of general interest such as state-of-the-project and BoFs based on the themes of the conference and the mini-symposia topics.  For more information, see our BoF page (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/bofs/) .

Some example past BoFs include Reproducibility, Teaching Scientific Computing with Python, The Future of Array Oriented Programming, PyNE Updates, Python and Finance, NumFOCUS, Python in Astronomy, SciPy Next Year, Collaborating and Contributing in Open Science, and the Matplotlib Enhancement Proposal Discussion.

We would like to solicit the community for ideas and organizers for other BoF topics. Please include a small description of the BoF, possible panelists, and whether you would be willing to moderate.  Submissions can be made at the main abstract submission page (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/) .


Present a Tutorial
------------------------------------------------------------
SciPy always kicks off with two days of tutorials. These sessions provide extremely affordable access to expert training, and consistently receive fantastic feedback from participants. This year we are expanding the tutorial session to include three parallel tracks: introductory, intermediate, and advanced.

The introductory track specifically targets programmers with no prior knowledge of scientific python and to ensure a consistent overall experience, the topics for these sessions have been fixed.  We have a full set of information and guidelines for submission (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/tutorials/) .

We are now accepting tutorial proposals from individuals or teams that would like to teach a tutorial at SciPy 2014 -- submissions are due on March 14, and we'd love to see what you have in store.  Whether you are a major contributor to a scientific Python library or an expert-level user, this is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and offset some of the costs of your SciPy 2014 attendance.  Submit your tutorial proposals today (https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/) !


GSoC @ SciPy 2014
------------------------------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Google Summer of Code!  We'll be announcing more details soon as well as highlighting specific projects and people involved in 2014.  Stay tuned!
