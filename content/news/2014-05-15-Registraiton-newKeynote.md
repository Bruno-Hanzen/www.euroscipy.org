New Keynote Speaker!

We're pleased to announce Nick Coghlan as a keynote speaker for the SciPy conference.  Nick is a CPython core developer, a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. He is the author or co-author of several accepted Python Enhancement Proposals, including PEP 343 (which added the with statement and context managers to the language), and PEP 453 (which integrated the "pip" package manager with the CPython installation process). Nick has also accepted a number of PEPs on Guido van Rossum's behalf, and is the current default BDFL-Delegate for packaging related PEPs.
